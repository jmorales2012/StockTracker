Stock Tracker - Console-Based Watchlists

This is a console-based stock watchlist app. It allows the user to create or load a watchlist,

refresh their watchlist to get latest prices. 

How To:
- Start the program
- Create a new watchlist or load one from an existing .txt file
- Edit your list by adding/removing stocks
- Update pricing on your stocks
- Save the watchlist for later use
