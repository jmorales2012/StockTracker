Stock Tracker - Console-Based Watchlists

This is a console-based stock watchlist app. It allows the user to create or load a watchlist, 
add and remove stocks from the watchlist, and save the list for later use. Users can also
refresh their watchlist to get latest prices. 

All stock info is fetched using the (TwelveData API)[https://twelvedata.com/docs]. 

If any errors found, please reach out to me and I'll do my best to get them fixed!
